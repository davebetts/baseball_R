    I’d like to recognize some of my friends that have helped me so much in baseball. Honorable Mayor of Cooperstown, the director of Baseball Hall of Fame, Mr. Lieb and Mr. Frick. Also Joe Cronin, American League. We started out together. Also, Mr. Giles of the National League. I just wanted to say, also, to the press and the photographers, they’ve been wonderful to me and I certainly do appreciate it. Another thing that I want to say, I’ve had many and many a thrill in baseball. I’ve had some sad moments, you know, losing a close one when you made a bad play or something, which goes with baseball. And also I want to say it’s such a great thrill to me today. In fact, this is my biggest thrill I’ve ever had. To think that I have been put in the Hall of Fame with such great baseball players of all time. I also want to say thank you to my many friends all over the country, and to my wonderful, wonderful fans all over the country that have stuck by me and helped me so much in baseball. I certainly feel honored and so proud to be here and about all I can say now, words cannot explain the way I feel about. So all I can say now is God bless everybody, always and thank you a lot.At this time, I would like to present my wife and my family. My wife, my daughters, my sisters, and my son. Grandson. Thank you a whole lot. To everybody.
