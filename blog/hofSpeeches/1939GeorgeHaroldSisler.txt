    Ladies and gentlemen, I think I’m one of the yougsters of this Hall of Fame, but it certainly is nice to be back here, and to greet all you gentlemen. I think it’s a great thing for baseball to commemorate the fine records of all these great men that have played baseball during the time that baseball has been played. And I’m certainly glad to do my little part today in helping this great day.
