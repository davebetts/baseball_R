    Mr. Commissioner, you did mention about my other records that everybody knows about, but nobody knows about the errors I make in my ten years in baseball. Before I start my short speech, and I guarantee its going to be the shortest you ever hear in one of the Hall of Fame ceremonies. (applause) In 1946 one of the members of the Hall of Fame is here today, he played in my country before he come out to the big leagues. He was my father’s teammate and I was a batboy. This is only one Roy Campanella. (applause) God bless you Roy. Ladies and gentlemen, when I first come to this country, 30 years ago, I was a young with very little in my pocket and full of dreams and the whole world to gain. There were moments of disappointment and frustration, but my love for this great game of baseball and the help and encouragement I got from my teammates and friends was stronger than obstacles or whether the Hall of Fame for me was just a far away dreams, I work hard to do my best for my team, for the fans. For they all go to also love this game and for baseball itself, what is worth for me to be among the greatest players in baseball history will always mean much more than I can say. I thank my father, to whom I owe the first secrets I learned from them professional. I thank all my teammates, from the front office to the batboy. I thank the writers, and the Hall, and the sports news media. I thank my wife and my kids. Today just my wife is here. I thank all the people and the great nation and above all I thank God. Today, 30 years after I first come to this country, I thank to you very much, I thank to God to give me ability to play the greatest game in the world. Thank you very much.
