    Thank you, Mr. Commissioner. And you baseball dignitaries and you fellow baseball players, ladies and gentlemen. Over a span of about 34 years in the game a lot of wonderful things and a lot of thrills have come my way. But today, the honor that comes to me standing here at this platform is the greatest thing that I think could happen to any baseball player in the world. So, I would like to thank all of those who assisted me along the way through my career. Thanks to the press and the baseball men that made it possible for me to be here. And with that, I will accept this plaque with pride and humbleness. Thank you.
