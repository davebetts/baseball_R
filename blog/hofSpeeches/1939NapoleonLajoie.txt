    Ladies and gentlemen, I’m very glad to be here today and to meet all the old-timers that you probably watched play baseball and some of the greatest men that ever walked on the ball feild, and I am glad to have the honor to be here today and join with them, and I hope everybody enjoys as I do because I’m certainly having a great day. Thank you.
