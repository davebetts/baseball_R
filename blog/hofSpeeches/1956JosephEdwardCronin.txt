    Commissioner Frick, baseball officials both American and National League, great stars of the past. This is indeed the greatest thrill of my career. I’ve had a lot of heartaches in baseball as you do. Coming on this platform today reminded me of a few. When I saw “Marse Joe” McCarthy sitting over there, and he was winning pennants and the Red Sox were continually finishing second. But as you walk through the halls of this great shrine it brings back wonderful memories. See plaques of Herb Pennock and Walter Johnson and other great distinguished ball players it’s been associated with over the years. Men that have done so much for baseball before we young fries came into it. Traditions that they have set that we’re trying to follow. I’d like at this time to congratulate Hank Greenberg and to say that I’m very happy to have seen him when he was in his prime performing great deeds on the ball field. I was very fortunate ladies and gentlemen, in closing, to tell you that I’ve been associated with two of the greatest men in the history of baseball for a great number of years, Clark Griffith and Tom Yawkey. Thank you.
