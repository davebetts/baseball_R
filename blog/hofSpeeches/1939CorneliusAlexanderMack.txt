    I feel greatly honored being here today where our first National Game was started by Major Abner Doubleday. I want to express my appreciation to the people of Cooperstown, New York for having the game of baseball started here in this town of Cooperstown by the Major General Abner Doubleday.I want to express my sincere thanks for having my name enrolled with the other great stars of baseball and with all of those who, the interest of baseball for the past hundred years. And I am quite positive that in the years to come that we can look forward to our game still progressing due to the fact that we have the honorable Mr. Branham at the head of the National Association of Baseball as well as Mr. Ford Frick of the National League and Mr. William Harridge of the American League, and above all we have the great and honorable Kenesaw M.
