    Thank you, Mr. Commissioner, members of the Hall of Fame Committee, old-timers who voted me in, the new inductees and the others that are here. This is indeed the greatest pleasure I’ve ever had in my life and batting so high in the line up, third. I’m not used to this and so I really don’t know what to say but I know that there is nobody up here any happier than I am today. And I also, like Yogi, I want to thank the New York Yankees for giving me the chance and my teammates who scored so many runs and helped me, and Joe DiMaggio who ran down all my mistakes and certainly last but not least the late Johnny Murphy who, the last couple of years that I pitched, if it wasn’t for John I wouldn’t be here either, believe me. And to my wonderful family sitting out there, my wife June, my son Duane, my son-in-law Steve, my daughter Sharon. I’ve got the first three rows and my son-in-law, Dr. Banas, my two grandsons John and Andy, and my daughter Vernona. I wish you’d stand please. And some more Gomez’ at home that couldn’t make it. And again thank you so much and I only hope that I can live up to the expectations that the so many wonderful and great players who have gone into the Hall of Fame before me. Thank you very much.
