    Thank you, Ford. Ladies and Gentlemen, I’m glad to have been put in baseball’s Hall of Fame. And I want to thank the committee that voted me in this year. This is quite a place. I spent most of the day yesterday looking things over in the Hall, here. It’s quite a place, but I’m glad I’m in along with the rest of fellows and I want to say thank you to all of you.
