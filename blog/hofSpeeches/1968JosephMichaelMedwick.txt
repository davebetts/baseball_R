    Mr. Eckert, ladies and gentlemen. It’s been a long time coming, but I’m very, very proud to be among the great Hall of Famers. I’ve been very fortunate all my life, worked hard, never realizing when I started baseball in 1932 that I would become a Hall of Famer. I don’t think that there is anything in baseball that could happen, hasn’t happened to me. And of course, this rounds out my life. To me it’s a privilege and an honor to be here with these great men. I am very happy too, to have my wife, my daughter and son, and their families, will they please stand up? And my other relations by marriage, Mr., Doctor Will and his wife. But, of course, behind everyone’s success there is a man and I want Amity Woleschlager, a friend of mine, helped encourage me to get into the Hall of Fame. Amity. I also want to thank my wonderful friends from Carteret and New Brunswick who came up here by bus. Thank you very, very much.
