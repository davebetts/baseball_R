    I thank you. You know I had many a thrill in my baseball career, and many a treat, but I consider this the greatest treat and one of the biggest thrills I had in my long time in baseball. I’m proud to be a member of these gentlemen who have been here before me, and will follow me up here, and in my dreams I often think what I could do today with a team like they were if they could be now what they were then. (laughs from crowd) I would have no mistakes to be worrying about or when they hit those line drives off me I would have no trouble wondering who was going to get them. I do wish to say a proud moment in my life to be here with these gentlemen, and I wish to thank one and all very kindly.
