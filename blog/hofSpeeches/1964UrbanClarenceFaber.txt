    Mr. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great honor to me to be named to the Hall of Fame. It’s very hard for me to even imagine that I would ever be elected to it, but now that I am and about to join all those celebrities that I used to know and play against and with, why, I hardly know what to say. I know they are all baseball fans, they must be or they wouldn’t have come this far to see an event like this. And I’m happy to greet you all in our behalf. Thank you.
