    Thank you, Mr. Commissioner. And Joe Cronin, president of the American League, Mr. Warren Giles, the president of the National League, and Commissioner Eckert, I thank him for his invitation to me to the All-Star game. Naturally, this is a happy day of my life. It’s one that I’m proud of. I have been lucky and I want to thank God who gave me the health, the strength to compete with these great players. I want to thank all those who selected me as their choice at this great honor. It will be one…I will never forget. I will take it with me to my grave. Thank you.
