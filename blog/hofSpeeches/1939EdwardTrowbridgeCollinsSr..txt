    Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. This is about the proudest day of my life, to be able to rub elbows with the players that are here today, I feel that I’d be glad to be the batboy for such a team as this. (laughs from crowd) Certainly a happy moment for me, and I’m most grateful to the baseball writers who have made it possible for me to be in this Hall of Fame. Thank you very much.
