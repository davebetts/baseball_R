    Thank you Tilly, and I guess it’s good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I’m not going to take up a great deal of time, Connie Mack really made a speech for all of us. I’m very happy indeed to have been chosen by the sportswriters as a member of this great Hall of Fame. Our time is very limited so I’m going to thank you again and let someone else come on. Thank you.
