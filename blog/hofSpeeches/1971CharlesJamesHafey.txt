    First, I’d like to thank Mr. Kuhn, the Veterans Committee and all the officials and men who put me in. This is the greatest thing that ever happened to me in baseball. I really appreciate it. I’m awful happy, and all the people who came out to see us and thank you very much. I’ll come back next year. Thank you very much.
