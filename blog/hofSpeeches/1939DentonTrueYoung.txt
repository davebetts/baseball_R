    Folks, I am like the other boys that preceeded me. I’m glad to be here today, in honor of this statuary, this Hall of Fame, that I was able to go through twenty-two odd years and do what I did, and to have my name on the record. I’m very glad to be here, nothing pleases me bettter than to be about and see and know that the young generation today is following our footsteps, going along throughout our land. One of the greatest games on earth, I don’t think, and I do hope and wish that in a hundred years from now the game will still be greater. I thank you very much.
