    Thank you, commissioner. I guess the first thing I should do is thank everybody who made this day necessary, but since this is the most important day of my life I want to get it right, so that’s why I’m gonna read it. I’m really happy to be here today. Thank God I made it. I always loved the game of baseball. I gave it everything I had. I’m glad I had a chance to play as long as I did. I hope my being here will be an inspiration for every boy in America. I can’t begin to thank everyone who helped me achieve this goal; scouts, teammates, managers, broadcasters, and photographers. But I have to mention Bill Dickey, who gave me some pointers on catching that put me on the right track, and, of course, Casey for having enough faith in me to play in the lineup every day, and also George Weiss, who gave me my first contract with the New York Yankees. Being with them was a dream come true, and now the Hall of Fame. But I couldn’t have made it without the cooperation of my family. Carmen is a perfect baseball wife. She planned our entire lives around the game; and Larry, Timmy, and Dale always knew it was the right way and I wish they would stand up. My only regrets are for those who didn’t live to see this day; my mother, my father who died several years ago, my brother John and Gil Hodges, who died this year. I want to thank the Yankees and the Mets, the only two organizations in baseball I worked for. I would like to thank all of my loyal fans who supported me all these years. I hope they are proud of me today. Also my friends who came to share this day with me. I want to congratulate all the men who are being inducted here today. And last of all I want to thank baseball. It has given me more than I could ever hope for, and I hope that when I am through with this game I will put something back. Thank you very much.
