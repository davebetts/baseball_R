    Thank you, commissioner. And to all distinguished guests, platform guests, and distinguished Hall of Famers, I think they’re distinguished men too. I started out my career quite young and I had some very good times, and I had bad times as Billy Herman said. But I’ve enjoyed most of them and now I’m going to be like him, I’m going to introduce my wife first, so I won’t run out before she’s—where’s my wife? Oh, there she is. When one can put up with me for 51 years she’s gotta be good. And I have my daughter and her husband Billy Bruton. I’m quite sure a lot of you remember him when he played with the Milwaukee Braves. I have a host of friends out there I call my group and I would like to see all of them stand, please. I forgot, my brother and his wife and daughter is out there. I want to thank the Philadelphia Phillies, Mr. Carpenter, his son and the wonderful personnel of that wonderful team. They’ve been extraordinarily good to me. I just can’t find words to express the feeling toward that group. It’s a wonderful group, it’s a wonderful group to work for and I’ll never forget them. And a lot of them are here today and I wish some of ‘em, if they’re here, I wish they’d stand. I see Mr. Green right down there. Mr. Dallas Green, former director, his wife is standing there and Dallas and a lot of the rest of them around here some place. But they’re all here, and Star Post Legion Post No. 30 of Wilmington. They had a bus that ran up here and they’re all around here some place and they’ve been very nice to me. And so many nice people have been good to me coming up. I want to thank all of them. I’ll be all right.
