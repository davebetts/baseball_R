    Thank you Mr. Commissioner, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. I don’t know how come my hands are so wet and my throat so dry. That Buck is a tough guy to follow. I don’t believe the words are within me to express my gratitude for being elected into the Hall of Fame. But a little unlike Yogi I was trying to figure out for the past few days who made this necessary and it goes back a long ways. My mother and father, my mother for wanting me to stop football, my father for playing catch with me so often. Being associated with people like Mr. Clark, the Old Fox Griffith, Calvin Griffith, Ossie Bluege, and so many in those twenty-three years in the majors and five years in the minors that I cannot remember. I just wish that I could have been better than I was and I think if the players today, and I wish I had a thought like this, that every time I played a game I was wanting to be an All-Star, play in the World Series, and be elected to the Hall of Fame. And I have. Thank you.
