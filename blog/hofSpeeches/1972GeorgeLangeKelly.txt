    Thanks very much. If the good Lord didn’t bless me with the tools to work with I wouldn’t be here today. Blessed be God forever. Today I’m doubly honored going into the Hall of Fame with a young man that came to the Boston Braves when I was a coach there under Casey Stengel. He learned his lessons well and his records speak for himself and I want to thank all those that gave me a helping hand on that long road to the top. And I want to thank all you people for being here to help celebrate this wonderful occasion. I want to thank and especially thank my fellow members from the San Francisco Old Timers Hall of Fame that are also here. And at this time I’d like to introduce my wife, Helen, and my son, Walter. In closing I’d just like to leave this little thought with you, the finest thing that life can send is a gift of one who you can call a friend. God bless you.
