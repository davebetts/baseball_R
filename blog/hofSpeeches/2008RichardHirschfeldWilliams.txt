    WHAT AN HONOR!AT 79, THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE TIMES IN MY LIFE, OTHER THAN MY 54 YEAR MARRIAGE TO NORMA AND THE BIRTH OF OUR CHILDREN, KATHI, RICK AND MARC. I LOVE YOU ALL AND COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT.I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M STANDING ON THIS DIAS WITH THE MOST TALENTED AND PRESTIGIOUS GENTLEMEN THE GAME HAS EVER SEEN BEHIND ME. I'VE PLAYED WITH SOME OF YOU, MANAGED SOME OF YOU, AND BOTH PLAYED AND MANAGED SOME OF YOU DURING MY LIFETIME.I KNEW WHEN I WAS A KID LIVING IN ST.LOUIS THAT I WANTED TO BE A BALLPLAYER, HOPEFULLY PLAY PROFESSIONALLY, BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS DID I EXPECT THE HONOR BEING BESTOWED ON ME HERE TODAY. I WAS A MEMBER OF THE ST.LOUIS CARDINALS AND ST.LOUIS BROWNS' KNOTHOLE GANG AT AGE 7-- ALTHOUGH YOU HAD TO BE 10 YEARS OF AGE TO BELONG. IM USED MY OLDER BROTHER ELERY'S PASS TO GET IN. ANY CHILD GROWING UP...IF YOU HAVE A DREAM, BE IT A FIREMAN, POLICEMAN, BASEBALL, FOOTBALL OR BASKETBALL PLAYER OR ANY OTHER GOAL, NEVER GIVE UP THAT DREAM. LOOK AT ME AND MY COLLEGUES STING BEHIND ME... IT CAN HAPPEN.I WOULDN'T BE HERE TOADY IF IT WEREN'T FOR SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE HELPED ME ALONG THE WAY. NEIL M AHONEY, THE LATE FARM DIRECTOR OF THE BOSTON RED SOX GAVE ME MY MANAGERIAL START AT TRIPLE A WITH TORONTO IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE AND AFTER WINNING THE GOVERNORS CUP TWO YEARS IN A ROW I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MANAGE THE PARENT RED SOX IN 1967 BY DICK O'CONNELL WHO TOOK A GAMBLE BY BRINGING IN A ROOKIE MANAGER. THAT WAS THE "IMPOSSIBLE DREAM" YEAR FOR BOSTON. I WAS COCKY ENOUGH TO LEASE AN APARTMENT FOR THREE YEARS AND BUY FURNITURE TO PAY OFF IN THREE YEARS WITH JUST A ONE YEAR CONTRACT. CARL YASTRZEMSKI HAD A YEAR I NEVER WATCHED A PLAYER HAVE BEFORE OR SINCE IN ALL PHASES OF THE GAME. THE HALL OF FAMER IS THE LAST TRIPLE CROWN WINNER AND WAS THE MVP. SHARING THAT WONDERFUL YEAR WITH ME WAS MY GOOD FRIEND AND HALL OF FAMER BOBBY DOERR, OUR HITTING AND FIRST BASE COACH.WE'VE ALL HAD SOMEONE SPECIAL WHO HAS PUSHED US ALONG THE WAY. I HAD BRANCH RICKEY AND THE BROOKLYN DODGERS ORGANIZATION WHO TAUGHT ME THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GAME ALONG WITH MY FIRST MENTOR BOBBY BRAGAN, WHO I'LL ALWAYS BE INDEBTED TO... BLESS YOU BOBBY!AFTER MY STAY IN BOSTON, I COACHED UNDER MANAGER GENE MAUCH IN MONTREAL AND HE TAUGHT ME MORE ABOUT MANAGING THAT ANY OTHER PERSON. IF THEY HELD A MANAGERS' CLINIC, I WOULD HAVE WANTED GENE TO RUN IT.IN 1970, AT THE END OF THE SEASON WITH MONTREAL, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM CHARLIE FINLEY, OFFERING ME THE MANAGERS' JOB WITH THE OAKLAND A'S. WHAT A ROLLER COASTER RIDE IT WAS-- WINNING THREE DIVISION TITLES, TWO LEAGUE TITLES AND TWO WORLD SERIES, DOING IT ALL WITH LONG HAIR, MUSTACHES AND BEARDS, WHICH CHARLIE APPROVED OF-- OR SUGGESTED. IT STARTED WITH CHARLIE HAVING A MUSTACHE DAY-- MEN AND WOMEN WERE ADMITTED FREE IF THEY HAD A REAL MUSTACHE AND EACH TEAM MEMBER RECEIVED $300 FOR GROWING ONE. WE DIDN'T LOOK TOO NEAT AND THE FANS AND THE MEDIA WERE SOMEWHAT AMAZED, BUT IT WAS THE BEST CLUB I EVER MANAGED WITH HALL OF FAMERS LIKE REGGIE JACKSON, THE LATE JIM "CATFISH" HUNTER AND ROLLIE FINGERS. I'M PROUD TO BE ENSHRINED AS AN OAKLAND A. PLAYERS MAKE MANAGERS, MANAGERS DON'T MAKE PLAYERS. I'VE MANAGED SIX DIFFERENT TEAMS AND THE GUYS BEHIND ME WANT ALL OF US TO BE BRIEF, SO I'LL JUST TOUCH BASE ON WINNING IN SAN DIEGO IN 1984 WITH GOOSE GOSSAGE AND TONY GWYNN. GOOSE AND GRAIG NETTLES ALONG WITH GARRY TEMPLETON, HUNG AROUND AFTER THE GAMES AND TALKED BASEBALL WITH OUR YOUNG KIDS. I WASN'T THE EASIEST MANAGER TO PLAY FOR BECAUSE I WAS VERY DEMANDING, SO IT WASN'T ALWAYS A BED OF ROSES. TIM FLANNERY SAID THAT I WAS ONE OF HIS BEST MANAGERS, BUT WHEN HE RETIRED AS A PLAYER, HIS GOAL WAS TO RUN ME OVER WITH HIS CAR. TIMMY AND I LAUGH ABOUT IT NOW, BUT I STILL KEEP TRACK OF EVERY CAR HE OWNS AND WHERE HE LIVES. RAY KROC WAS OUR OWNER AND JACK MCKEON WAS OUR GENERAL MANAGER WHEN I SIGNED IN 1982. WE HAD A CELEBRATION LUNCH IN RAY'S OFFICE. I HAD A #4, BIG MAC, FRIES AND A MALT-- ASK JACK-- HE HAD A #3. MCKEON WAS A GOOD G.M AND HE PUT TOGETHER A GOOD TEAM, BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD, WHICH HE DID AFTER I LEFT. JACK DID WELL AT CINCINNATI AND LATER WON A WORLD SERIES WITH THE FLORIDA MARLINS. WHO SAID THAT SENIOR CITIZENS CAN'T DO THE JOB. JACK IS LIVING PROOF.I HAD A SHORT STAY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ANGELS WHEN I TOOK OVER IN JULY OF 1974, BUT THE OWNER, GENE AUTRY, WAS OUTSTANDING AND NOLAN RYAN PITCHED ONE OF HIS MANY NO-HITTERS. I LOST MY FIRST TEN GAMES WHICH PROMPTED GENE TO TELL MY COACH WHITEY HERZOG--"I THINK I HIRED THE WRONG MANAGER".MONTREAL WAS A GREAT CITY AND I ENJOYED MY FIVE YEARS THERE. THEY HAD LOST 107 GAMES IN 1976, THE YEAR BEFORE CHARLIE FOX BECAME THE G.M. AND I WAS THE FIELD MANAGER. IN MY THIRD YEAR WE WON 95 GAMES, BUT FINISHED SECOND TO PITTSBURGH AND THE NEXT YEAR WE WON 92 GAMES BUT FINISHED SECOND TO PHILADELPHIA. IN 1981, MONTREAL WON THE SECOND HALF OF THE EAST DIVISION AND BEAT THE PHILLIES IN A PLAYOFF TO WIN THE EAST, BUT LOST TO THE DODGERS FOR THE NATIONAL LEAGUE TITLE. I WAS GONE BEFORE THE SEASON ENDED AND JIM FANNING BROUGHT THEM IN. WE DREW WELL AT THE GATE AND HALL OF FAMERS GARY CARTER AND TONY PEREZ LED THE WAY. MY LAST MANAGING STINT WAS AT SEATTLE AND THIS WAS WHEN THE "FAT LADY" FINALLY SANG. WE ALL HAVE TO QUIT SOMETIME. MY ASSOCIATION WITH LONGTIME ANNOUNCING FRIEND AND THIS YEARS FORD FRICK AWARD WINNER DAVE NIEHAUS WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY STAY IN SEATTLE-- ONE OF NORMAN'S FAVORITE CITIES.PLAYING IN THE JACKIE GLEASON GOLF CLASSIC IN 1974, MY GOOD FRIEND DICK HOLLEBECK WAS HOLDING MY WATCH AND OAKLAND A'S WORLD SERIES RING WHILE I PLAYED. AFTERWORDS, WE WERE IN THE COFFEE SHOP WITH JOE DIMAGGIO AND DON SHULA AND JOE SAW MY RING. HE SAID "I KNOW YOU'RE PROUD OF THAT RING, BUT THE RING I'M WEARING, THE HALL OF FAME RING, IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RING YOU'LL EVER HOPE TO HAVE" I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT MOMENT TO ARRIVE.I CAN'T FORGET MY TEN YEARS WITH GEORGE STEINBRENNER AFTER MY MANAGING DAYS. WHAT A WONDERFUL TIME AS A SCOUT AND ADVISOR WITH A TRULY GREAT PERSON. THANKS VERY MUCH, GEORGE! PAUL RICHARDS KEPT MY PLAYING DAYS ALIVE IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES BY ACQUIRING ME FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES AND EDDIE STANKY WAS MY OLDEST SON RICK'S COLLEGE COACH AT SOUTH ALABAMA. RICK SAID HE FELT RIGHT AT HOME BECAUSE EDDIE'S PERSONALITY WAS JUST LIKE HIS DAD'S. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A COMPLIMENT OR NOT, RICK?SPARKY ANDERSON TOLD ME, WHEN HE CALLED TO CONGRATULATE ME, "DICK, YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THE FEELING WAITING WITH ALL OF YOUR PEERS TO GO UP TO THE DIAS" HE WAS RIGHT. IT'S THE BIGGEST HONOR OF MY BASEBALL LIFE AND MAKES IT HARD TO KEEP MY EMOTIONS INTACT, ESPECIALLY GOING IN WITH GOOSE AND DAVID. AS I SAID BEFORE, I'M 79 YEARS OF AGE. MY ONE BIG WISH IF I WAS EVER GOING TO BE ELECTED INTO THE HALL WAS THAT MY WIFE NORMA, MY CHILDREN, MY GRANDCHILDREN AND MY FRIENDS WOULD BE HERE WITH ME TO WITNESS THIS GLORIOUS EVENT. IT HAS ALL COME TRUE.THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
