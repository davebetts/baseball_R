    Mr. Chairman, I started my career before the Hall of Fame was started. It’s been wonderful. I don’t know how a fellow can get old so fast. It impresses me here, I don’t know whether I’m nervous or whether I’m ice cold, or both. But I’ll tell you this, it’s great to be here. I want to thank everybody. Opponents that helped beat me, players that were on the club that I played on. Newspapermen, press, television, radio. I want to thank the good friends at Clear Lake, Wisconsin and Trenton, Missouri. I’m happy to be here and I’m happy that it came soon enough that I could receive this plaque. I thank you.
